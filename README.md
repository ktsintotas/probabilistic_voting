# Visual Place Recognition with Probabilistic Voting

This open source MATLAB algorith presents a modified and straightforward probabilistic visual place recognition technique which introduces a novel score based on nearest neighbor descriptor voting. Based on the observation that the number of votes for matching places can be evaluated using a binomial distribution model, loop closures can be detected with high precision. By casting the problem into a probabilistic framework, the need for commonly employed heuristic parameters are removed.

Note that the probabilistic voting approach is not an official implementation based on binary features, while it utilizes SURF in order to be used for comparison for our research works. The authors are not responsible for any errors it may contain. **Use it at your own risk!**
